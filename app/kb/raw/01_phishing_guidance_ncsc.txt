Title: Phishing – Defending Your Organisation
Citation: (NCSC, 2024)

Summary:
Phishing is a social‑engineering technique that uses deceptive messages and websites to steal credentials, plant malware, or obtain sensitive data. {cite} emphasises layered defence: email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), attachment and URL filtering, user training with realistic simulations, and a simple reporting route. Users should verify sender domains, be wary of urgent payment or credential requests, and hover to preview links before clicking. Organisations should rehearse incident playbooks so that when a user reports a suspected phish, IT can rapidly contain and investigate while preserving evidence. Clear feedback loops encourage reporting and improve resilience over time.
