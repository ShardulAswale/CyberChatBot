Summary:
Phishing does not only arrive by email. {cite} explains that SMS messages (smishing), phone calls (vishing), QR codes (quishing), and social media DMs are common vectors. Treat unsolicited links or requests for codes with caution. In the UK, suspicious emails can be forwarded to report@phishing.gov.uk and suspicious texts to 7726 (free). Never share MFA codes or passwords on a call; instead, hang up and contact the organisation via a trusted number. Report incidents to your security team promptly so malicious infrastructure can be taken down quickly.
