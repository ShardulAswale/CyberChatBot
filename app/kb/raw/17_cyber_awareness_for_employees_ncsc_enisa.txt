Summary:
Effective awareness programmes combine micro‑learning, simulations, policy nudges, and just‑in‑time education. {cite} recommends embedding training in onboarding, communicating simple reporting routes, and measuring outcomes (e.g., reporting rates, simulation improvement). Use positive reinforcement over blame to build a strong security culture. Tailor content to roles (finance, HR, IT) and keep messages short, relevant, and scenario‑based.
