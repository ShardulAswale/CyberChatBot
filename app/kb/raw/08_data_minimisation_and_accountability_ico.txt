Summary:
The UK GDPR requires collecting and retaining only data that is necessary for a specified purpose, and being able to demonstrate compliance. {cite} advises defining purposes clearly, restricting access by role, setting retention schedules, and deleting or anonymising data when no longer needed. Document decisions and assign responsibility so you can evidence compliance to regulators, partners, and data subjects.
