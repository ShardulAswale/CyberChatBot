Summary:
{cite} advises using long, memorable passphrases, unique per account, supported by enterprise password managers. Avoid forced regular resets unless compromise is suspected; focus on blocking common and breached passwords. Combine passwords with multi‑factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible to reduce account takeovers. Never share passwords via email or chat, and avoid storing them in plain text. For service accounts, use vaulting and rotation with strict ownership and monitoring.
