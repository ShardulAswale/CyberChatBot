Title: Zero Trust Architecture – Principles
Citation: (NIST, 2020)
URL: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final

Summary:
Zero Trust assumes no implicit trust based on network location. {cite} centres on continuous verification, least privilege, and assume‑breach thinking. Implement strong identity, device health checks, context‑aware access policies, micro‑segmentation, and continuous monitoring. Start with high‑value data flows, define policy decision points, and measure success by reducing attack paths and blast radius.
