Title: Ransomware – Prepare, Prevent, Respond
Citation: (NCSC, 2024)

Summary:
Ransomware encrypts files and demands payment for decryption. {cite} recommends a defence‑in‑depth approach: timely patching, least‑privilege access, application allow‑listing, robust email and web filtering, and tested offline backups. If ransomware is suspected, isolate affected devices, avoid rebooting, preserve logs, and activate the incident response plan. Paying ransoms is discouraged; it does not guarantee data recovery and may encourage further crime. Business continuity hinges on rehearsed recovery and backup integrity checks.
