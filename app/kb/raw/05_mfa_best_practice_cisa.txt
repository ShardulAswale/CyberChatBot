Citation: (CISA, 2023)

Summary:
MFA adds a second factor (something you have/are) to your password (something you know). {cite} highlights that phishing‑resistant MFA (FIDO2/security keys or platform authenticators) is preferred over SMS codes. Enrol multiple factors to avoid lockouts, secure recovery processes, and monitor for unusual sign‑in prompts. Educate users never to approve unexpected push notifications and to report any suspicious prompts immediately.
