Project Deliverables 
    a) Professional / Commercial Presentation and Introduction – 10%

Deliver a professional consultancy-style presentation introducing the following. 

    • Your consultancy team name, roles, and expertise areas.
    • The project purpose, objectives, and key questions being addressed.
    • Client Profile: Highlight their concerns about phishing, weak passwords, and data leaks due to low cybersecurity awareness.
    • Business Problem related to Employees or students frequently fall victim to phishing emails or unsafe online behaviours, leading to compliance and data protection issues.
    • Objective of the project i.e., to enhance cybersecurity culture, automate awareness training, and provide 24/7 access to support.
    • Possible Stakeholders e.g., IT security department, HR (training), compliance officers, and end-users.
    • Functional Requirements: Chatbot should answer FAQs on safe practices, password management, phishing, social engineering, etc. Support both text-based conversation and guided awareness modules.
    • Non-functional Requirements: Easy to use, scalable, privacy-preserving, and accessible across devices.

    b) Context – Business / Requirement Analysis of the Organisation – 20%
Conduct an analysis of the educational organization’s current context to define business needs and data requirements. You could consider the following factors. 
• Business goals:
Improve employee cybersecurity awareness, reduce human-related security incidents, ensure compliance with security policies, and promote continuous learning through an engaging chatbot platform.
• Stakeholder analysis:
Key stakeholders include the IT security team, HR and training departments, compliance officers, and all employees who will interact with the chatbot as end users.
• Requirement analysis:
The chatbot must provide accurate responses to common cybersecurity questions, deliver interactive awareness training modules, track user engagement, and integrate with internal communication systems such as Microsoft Teams or Slack.

    c) Method of Research Including Ethics / Practical Work Design – 10%
A methodological section explaining how research, design, and implementation were conducted ethically and technically.
    • Chatbot Design Process:
        ◦ Use of any NLP framework 
        ◦ Define chatbot intents (topics like “password safety,” “phishing,” “malware”).
        ◦ Train conversational models using curated datasets
    • Ethical Considerations:
        ◦ Ensure chatbot data privacy, no sensitive data collection.
        ◦ Provide transparent disclaimers, the chatbot is for guidance, not incident response.
        ◦ Promote responsible AI use, no bias, misinformation, or intrusive data gathering.

    d) Research Discussion and Findings / Practical Implementation and Testing – 30%
Detailed report section showing system implementation, testing and discussion. 
Implementation:
    • Develop a functional prototype of the chatbot either text-based or web interface.
    • Integrate simple question-answering logic with NLP or any other possible approach for context understanding.
    • Train model on curated cybersecurity FAQs e.g., identifying phishing emails, safe browsing, password best practices.
Testing and Evaluation:
    • Perform usability testing with a small group of users.
    • Record chatbot response accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction.
    • Analyse chatbot logs to identify frequent user queries and gaps.
Discussion of Findings:
    • Present success metrics such as accuracy %, average response time.
    • Highlight limitations e.g., limited domain scope, dependency on training data.
    • Discuss AI’s effectiveness in promoting cybersecurity awareness.
